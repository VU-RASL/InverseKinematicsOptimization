## But first... I have to apologize for some things

I messed up my previous repository -- what's the word? -- royally. (Some very weird issues with Git LFS and authentication?) It's still available here: <https://github.com/VU-RASL/InverseKinematics>. Check it out if you want to see some older history...

## Project Description

_Improving Augmented Reality Pose Redirection Using Potential Functions and Gradient Descent_

As shown throughout this class, augmented reality has the ability to revolutionize remote work and collaboration. However, there are issues with collaborating between real and virtual environments, such as transferring poses between the environments [^5]. Pose redirection can be viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem, with the two objectives being to minimize the position error [^5]. It also works to minimize the difference between the ground-truth's pose and the new pose - the model favors new poses that are closer to the existing pose. Previous work for rerouting poses relies on BioIK and its genetic algorithm implementation. In this problem, BioIK employs genetic algorithm optimization to find the solution to the placement of the arm, but it does not do anything to optimize the angles of the individual joints of the arm [^3]. To counteract this problem, some people have tried dynamically weighting the two objectives [^4]. 

For my project, I want to explore other ways to optimize the pose redirection. For example, we can use other ideas from inverse kinematics to optimize both of our variables simulataneously. We can define two different objective functions: one function for the location for the hand, and one function for the difference in joint angles between the two poses, as used in [^4]. From [^1] and [^2], we can write the derivative of the two functions together like this (rewritten for clarity):

$$
d\theta = J_1^* \dot q_1 + (I_n - J_1^*J_1)(-\gamma \frac{dp}{d\theta})^T
$$

- Where:
    - $J_1^*$ is the Jacobian psuedo-inverse
    - $\dot q_1$ is a particular solution

In an engineering setting, this is used to calculate the velocity of the end of the link (usually a manipulator, but in this case a hand). However, this could also be used as part of our gradient descrnt, allowing the algorithm to explore on the gradient for both the main objective ($J_1^* \dot q_1$) and the secondary objective ($(I_n - J_1^*J_1)(-\gamma \frac{dp}{d\theta})^T$). The two objectives will be the ones in [^5]. By replacing the gradient step in BioIK with this expression, I'm hoping to be able to optimize both of the variables concurrently. Depending on time constraints, I will try to refine the weighting metric from [^5], potentially replacing the logistic function with another weighting function.

## Technical Details

I used Unity and the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit to create my project, with a modified version of the BioIK package used for the optimization process.

## Deploying

You should be able to deploy it directly using Holographic Remoting with the Hololens. See <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk3-overview/test-and-deploy/streaming> (It works but requires a hefty internet connection). If you want to actually install it on the Hololens, you'll need to install Visual Studio and build the project... (see these for steps: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/build-and-deploy-to-hololens> and <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/advanced-concepts/using-visual-studio>). All of the build settings _should_ be ok, but I've only tested it on Windows, so good luck on other OSes!

## Thank you!
